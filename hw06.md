# Computing Components
1. 控制器、运算器、存储器、输入输出设备 

2. 64MB = 64 * 2^20 = 2^26 即至少需要26位

3. CPU由控制器和数据通路（运算单元）组成。  
  数据通路部件包括：寄存器堆、数据存储器、指令存储器、加法器、ALU。  
  cache不是必要的。

4. seconda storage：除了主存之外的非易失性存储器。比如闪存、磁盘、光盘等。  
  
5.  * CPU：A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.  

    * RAM：Random-access memory (RAM /ræm/) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.   

    * ROM：Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.  

    * Bus (computing)：n computer architecture, a bus (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.  

    * Parallel Computing：
    Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but it's gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.

6. 云计算是在网络上提供服务的大服务器集群，一些运营商根据应用需求出租不同数量的服务器。云计算代替了传统的服务器，它依赖于称为仓储规模计算机的巨型数据中心。
